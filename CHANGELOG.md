## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Development scaffold (milestone M0): manifest, ESLint rules, tests, the strings sign-off gate,
  the asset and manifest checks, CI, and fixture actors for the local test harness. No features
  yet.
- Rules core (milestone M1), as pure functions with tests and not yet used in Foundry: the level,
  rarity and Craft DCs; Income Earned; Craft pricing, setup (with the formula, without it, the fixed
  setups and Complex Crafting's table), the frozen plan and the money each order step moves; extra-day
  reductions with level-up recompute, minimums and the level-20 critical-success row; batches,
  including ammunition and Efficient Alchemy; formula families and coverage; eligibility gates G1-G12;
  precious materials; Communal Crafting helpers and Aid; formula routes and acquisition jobs; Earn
  Income jobs; the coin planner (pf2e change-making, create-only strongbox plans) and the pro-rata
  splitter. The numeric tables ship as data modules cited by book and page.
- Storage and sync (milestone M2), with no window yet: the master switch, which has a GM create the shared
  ledger and strongbox that every player owns (and re-create or repair them); the schema version with a
  migration framework; the key-path store over the ledger; the responsible client with a one-tab lease;
  coin moves as lock-first batches using the coin planner; claims for refunds, wages and deliveries, with the
  GM relay as an accelerator; roster snapshots; deletion guards; the GM's purge of all data; reconciliation
  and the catch-up sweep at ready. Settings for the master switch, members, auto-claim and the rules-gap
  defaults. Live-harness scenario scripts for the multi-user cases.
